This repository contains my implementations of machine learning algorithms, inspired by Andrej Karpathy's "Zero to Hero" neural networks tutorial. My primary goal is to gain a deep, hands-on understanding of Deep Learning concepts and the foundations behind Large Language Models (LLMs).

By building these algorithms from scratch, I aim to demystify the inner workings of neural networks and related techniques, reinforcing my theoretical knowledge with practical coding experience.
