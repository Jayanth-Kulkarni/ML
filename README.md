# ML Algorithms from Scratch

This project is an effort to implement the most popular machine learning algorithms from the ground up. The primary goal is to deeply understand how these algorithms work by building them without relying on high-level, fully built libraries. Only minimal, essential libraries will be used. Everything else will be coded from scratch.
